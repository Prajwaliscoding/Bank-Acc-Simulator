# 🏦 Bank Account Program (Basic Version)

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that simulates basic bank account operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 📌 What It Does

- Creates a bank account with a name and starting balance
- Lets the user:
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money
  - Check the current balance

## 🧱 How It Works

The program uses a class called `Account` that includes:

- `__init__()` – sets the name and balance
- `deposit(amount)` – adds money to the balance
- `withdraw(amount)` – subtracts money if there are enough funds
- `check_amount()` – prints the current balance

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Save the code to a file named `bank_account.py`
2. Open terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
```
